### GitLab Repository

Unfortunately, I cannot share the code since the project is private and only accessible to team members.

### About WE Design

[WE Deign](https://www.windenergydesign.com/) is a club at the University of Manitoba. We focus on developing small-scale wind turbines to promote green energy. We're currently in Year 4 of our design process and gearing up for the International Small Wind Turbine Contest ([ISWTC](https://www.hanze.nl/en/research/centres/entrance-centre-of-expertise-energy/projects/international-small-wind-turbine-contest-iswtc)) in the Netherlands.

### 2024-25

I work with the Control Systems team and primarily write `C++` code for our microcontrollers and sensors that help with power power distribution and ultimately allow the turbines to spin, as well as change the orientation of the blades.

I also work with the team to update and maintain the team website and streamline local development. The website development is done using `Jekyll`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `GitHub Pages` for hosting.

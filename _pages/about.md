I am a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of Manitoba. I made the switch from Mathematics in the summer of 2022, with just under half of my degree left and am set to graduate in April 2025.

I love working with distributed systems, backend technologies, embedded systems, robotics and anything that begins or relates to the word _"cloud"_.

I am also an active member of two clubs at the University of Manitoba: [UMUAS](https://umuas.ca/) and [WE Design](https://www.windenergydesign.com/).
